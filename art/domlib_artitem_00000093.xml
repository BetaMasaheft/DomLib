<details class="MCRMetaLangText" heritable="false" notinherit="false"><detail xml:lang="en" inherited="0" form="plain">Extraordinarily well-preserved triptych from ca. 1500 CE, possibly executed by a foreign hand.&#13;
&#13;
Left panel, upper: Henchman in the act of beheading St. Paul. St. Paul, in a blue robe, is kneeling on the ground, his eyes are closed and he is bleeding profusely from his severed neck. He is depicted with a triangular, well-trimmed dark beard and a strongly receding dark hairline with a small, typical 'tuft' of hair on his forehead. The henchman, dressed in a red tunic with a yellow belt and red trousers and shoes reminiscent of Late Gothic Hour Book illuminations, holds his sword in the right hand still raised up in the air. His left hand is pressing down on St. Paul's shoulder. &#13;
Left panel, lower: St. George, on a white steed with red and yellow tack, is in the process of slaying the dragon. St. George is also dressed after European fashion, with a belted deep red tunic, yellow trousers and red shoes. A dark blue cloak is billowing out behind him and a stark yellow halo surrounds his head. His skin colour is noticeably dark. The horse's front hooves are raised off the ground, the dragon's tail is wrapped around its hind hooves. &#13;
&#13;
Central panel: St Mary is seated on a red cushion with geometric ornamentation in front of a red canopy, the naked infant Christ is seated on her right side sucking her right breast. Mary is depicted as wearing a blue maphrion with red lining over a green long tunic with red tuck and a noticeably low neckline, through which the Infant has accessed her breast. A yellow halo surrounds her head. She is holding the infant with her hands; the right hand was merged with the Christ's cross-shaped halo by the artist. She is looking down at her son with a sorrowful expression.&#13;
Jesus is depicted in an upright sitting position, stark naked, with the body of a small child. He grasps his mother's breast with both hands and looks up at his mother. A cross-shaped halo surrounds his head. &#13;
In the background behind the canopy, Michael and Gabriel depicted looking onto the scene. Their hands are crossed in front of their bodies; they are garbed in blue robes with a red belt and their wings fan out behind them. A red halo surrounds their heads. &#13;
&#13;
Right wing: On the green background, a henchman is seen as hauling St. Peter up by his feet over a yellow wooden high bar with a red canopy. The high-bar is constructed realistically and frames the scene. St. Peter is hanging upside down, bound at the ankles, his eyes are closed, his grey hair and beard are still neatly combed back. He is shown naked except for a green pair of draped under-drawers that still holds in place. His torso is realistically shaded. &#13;
The henchman is in the process of pulling the rope down lower, his arms are stretched above his head, he is biting his tongue in concentration. He is clad in a dark blue tunic (the same colour as Mary's maphrion and St. Paul's robe) with yellow trousers and red, pointed boots. His depiction is clearly aimed to look drawn from life - up to the point that the muscles of his thighs are clearly discernible under the trousers. &#13;
&#13;
The picture is very well executed in the manner of European late Gothic Hour Book Illuminations. Considerable care was put into the draft and alignment of the scenes, the execution, the drawing style. All faces are intricately shaded, suggesting three-dimensionality. The iconographic depiction of the beheading of St. Paul and the hanging of St. Peter are completely new elements for the time period under consideration.</detail>
